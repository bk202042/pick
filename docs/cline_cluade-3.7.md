Real Estate Listing Platform Implementation Plan
Based on my analysis of your project files, I'll outline a comprehensive implementation plan to transform the Next.js + Supabase starter kit into a full-featured real estate listing platform. This plan follows modern best practices for Next.js 14, TypeScript, and performance optimization.

Project Overview
You're building a real estate listing platform with the following key features:

Property browsing with search & filtering
User authentication (buyers, agents, admins)
Listing management for agents
Admin controls for oversight
Interactive map integration
Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture
Environment Setup

Configure environment variables
Set up database connection with Supabase
Establish proper TypeScript configuration
Data Access Layer (DAL)

Create a robust DAL structure in src/data/
Implement type-safe interfaces for all data operations
Set up Supabase client with proper authentication handling
Authentication System

Implement role-based authentication (user/agent/admin)
Create middleware for protected routes
Set up proper authentication flows with Supabase
